Design & UI Guidelines:
- **Aesthetic:** Create an elegant, professional interface inspired by Apple design principles.
- **Typography:** Use SF Pro (or a similar refined, sans-serif) font.
- **UI Elements:** Implement smooth, rounded edges on buttons, cards, and input fields; use subtle shadows and ample white space.
- **Layout:** Ensure a responsive design that looks fantastic on both desktop and mobile.
- **Animations:** Include subtle animations and transitions for an overall classy user experience.

Technical Requirements:
- **Backend:** Develop RESTful API endpoints using Node.js (Express) or Python (Flask/FastAPI) for handling authentication, email analysis, encryption, and AI unsubscription.
- **Frontend:** Build a modern PWA using React or Vue.js to provide the dashboard and user interfaces.
- **Database:** Use Replit’s built‑in database to store user settings, email data, and analysis logs.
- **Authentication:** Integrate Replit’s built-in OAuth for multi-provider SSO.
- **AI Integration:** Connect to OpenAI APIs to analyze email content, trigger scam alerts, and automate unsubscribe actions.
- **Azure Quantum Integration:** 
   - Incorporate calls to Azure Quantum’s API to generate quantum random bits. Use these bits to seed encryption routines, enhancing privacy.
   - Implement quantum-inspired optimization for refining email filtering rules based on user behavior and system feedback.

Project Scaffolding & Documentation:
1. Initialize a GitHub repository from Replit with clear module boundaries (authentication, email processing, AI integration, encryption, Azure Quantum).
2. Commit code regularly, and include documentation that outlines your architecture, API endpoints, and integration patterns.
3. Provide sample code snippets for key functionalities, such as:
   - An endpoint that analyzes email content using OpenAI.
   - A module that calls Azure Quantum to generate quantum random numbers.
   - A UI component that displays scam alerts and filtering settings in an Apple-inspired, elegant layout.
4. Use Replit’s real-time collaboration and deployment features to iterate rapidly.

Please generate a complete project outline with relevant code examples, ensuring that the design remains luxurious, minimalist, and professional while effectively integrating all of the above features and technologies.
