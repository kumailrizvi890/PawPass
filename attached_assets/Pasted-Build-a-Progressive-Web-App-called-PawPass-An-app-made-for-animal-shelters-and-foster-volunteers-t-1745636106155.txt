Build a Progressive Web App called “PawPass" An app made for animal shelters and foster volunteers to easily transfer pet information between shifts, volunteers, fosters, shelters —
without messy emails and Excel sheets.

Design & UI Guidelines:
- **Aesthetic:** Create an elegant, professional interface inspired by Apple design principles.
- **Typography:** Use SF Pro (or a similar refined, sans-serif) font.
- **UI Elements:** Implement smooth, rounded edges on buttons, cards, and input fields; use subtle shadows and ample white space.
- **Layout:** Ensure a responsive design that looks fantastic on both desktop and mobile.
- **Animations:** Include subtle animations and transitions for an overall classy user experience.
Technical Requirements:
- **Backend:** Develop RESTful API endpoints using Node.js (Express) or Python (Flask/FastAPI) for handling authentication, email analysis, encryption, and AI unsubscription.
- **Frontend:** Build a modern PWA using React or Vue.js to provide the dashboard and user interfaces.
- **Database:** Use Replit’s built‑in database to store user settings, email data, and analysis logs.
- **Authentication:** Integrate Replit’s built-in OAuth for multi-provider SSO.
- **AI Integration:** Connect to OpenAI APIs to create another section in the navbar that leads to a chatbot that can help the user with any problems related to the pet they are dealing wit. Make it sympathetic and kind and helpful
Project Scaffolding & Documentation:
1. Initialize a GitHub repository from Replit with clear module boundaries
2. Commit code regularly, and include documentation that outlines your architecture, API endpoints, and integration patterns.
3. Provide sample code snippets for key functionalities, such as:
   - An endpoint that analyzes email content using OpenAI.
4. Use Replit’s real-time collaboration and deployment features to iterate rapidly.
Please generate a complete project outline with relevant code examples, ensuring that the design remains luxurious, minimalist, and professional while effectively integrating all of the above features and technologies.
