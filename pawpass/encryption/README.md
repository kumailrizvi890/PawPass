# Encryption Module

## Overview

The Encryption module provides comprehensive data security for PawPass, ensuring that sensitive information is properly encrypted and protected. This module implements industry-standard encryption techniques to safeguard pet and user data.

## Features

- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- Secure credential storage
- Key management
- Encryption policy enforcement
- Audit logging of security events

## Components

### Data Encryption

- Field-level encryption for sensitive data
- Database encryption for data at rest
- HTTPS for data in transit

### Key Management

- Generation and rotation of encryption keys
- Secure key storage
- Key backup and recovery

### Security Auditing

- Logging of security-related events
- Access monitoring
- Compliance reporting

## Usage

```python
from pawpass.encryption import encrypt_data, decrypt_data, secure_store

# Encrypt sensitive data
encrypted_medical_info = encrypt_data(
    plaintext="Buddy requires daily medication for arthritis",
    context="pet_medical",
    user_id=123
)

# Decrypt data when needed
decrypted_info = decrypt_data(
    ciphertext=encrypted_medical_info,
    context="pet_medical",
    user_id=123
)

# Securely store credentials
secure_store.set("api_key", "sk_test_abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz")

# Retrieve stored credentials
api_key = secure_store.get("api_key")
```

## Encryption Algorithms

The module uses the following encryption algorithms:

- **AES-256-GCM**: For symmetric encryption of data at rest
- **RSA-2048**: For asymmetric encryption where needed
- **PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256**: For password-based key derivation
- **Ed25519**: For digital signatures

## Integration Points

- Authentication module: For user identity verification
- Database: For encrypting stored data
- Core application: For encrypting sensitive pet information

## Security Standards

The encryption implementation adheres to the following standards:

- NIST FIPS 140-2
- GDPR compliance requirements
- OWASP security best practices
- Industry standard key management practices

## Configuration

Encryption services are configured through environment variables:

- `ENCRYPTION_KEY_PROVIDER`: The key management service provider
- `ENCRYPTION_MASTER_KEY_ID`: Identifier for the master encryption key
- `ENCRYPTION_KEY_ROTATION_DAYS`: Frequency of key rotation in days
- `ENCRYPTION_AUDIT_LEVEL`: Level of audit logging (minimal, standard, verbose)

## Threat Mitigation

The module includes protection against:

- Brute force attacks through rate limiting
- Key extraction through secure key storage
- Data interception through transport layer security
- Side-channel attacks through constant-time implementations
