# Authentication Module

## Overview

The Authentication module handles user authentication, authorization, and session management for PawPass. It provides a secure way to authenticate users and control access to resources based on user roles.

## Features

- User registration and login
- Role-based access control
- Password hashing and verification
- Session management
- Multi-factor authentication (future)
- OAuth integration (future)

## Components

### User Management

- User creation and registration
- User profile management
- Password reset functionality

### Authentication

- JWT token generation and validation
- Session handling and persistence
- Login/logout workflows

### Authorization

- Role-based access control
- Permission checking and enforcement
- Resource ownership validation

## Usage

```python
from pawpass.auth import authenticate_user, require_auth, create_user

# Create a new user
user = create_user(username="volunteer1", password="secure_password", email="volunteer@example.com", role="volunteer")

# Authenticate a user
user, token = authenticate_user(username="volunteer1", password="secure_password")

# Protect a route
@app.route('/protected')
@require_auth(role=['admin', 'volunteer'])
def protected_route():
    return "This route is protected"
```

## API Endpoints (Future)

- `POST /auth/login`: Authenticate user and get token
- `POST /auth/register`: Register a new user
- `POST /auth/logout`: Invalidate token and end session
- `GET /auth/profile`: Get current user profile
- `POST /auth/password/reset`: Request password reset
- `POST /auth/password/change`: Change password

## Integration Points

- Core application: For user authentication and authorization
- Email module: For sending verification and password reset emails
- Encryption module: For secure credential storage

## Security Considerations

- Passwords are hashed using bcrypt
- Authentication tokens are signed and have expiration times
- Failed login attempts are rate-limited
- Sessions expire after a period of inactivity
- Sensitive operations require re-authentication
