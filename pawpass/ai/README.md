# AI Integration Module

## Overview

The AI Integration module enhances PawPass with artificial intelligence capabilities to provide pet care recommendations, analyze pet behavior, and offer predictive insights. This module leverages modern AI techniques to improve the overall pet care experience.

## Features

- Pet care recommendations based on historical data
- Behavior pattern analysis
- Health prediction and anomaly detection
- Natural language processing for care logs
- Image recognition for pet photos (future)

## Components

### Recommendation Engine

- Personalized pet care recommendations
- Dietary suggestions based on pet profiles
- Activity recommendations based on species, age, and health

### Behavior Analysis

- Pattern recognition in pet behavior
- Anomaly detection for health concerns
- Correlation analysis between care activities and outcomes

### Natural Language Processing

- Analysis of care update text
- Keyword extraction and categorization
- Sentiment analysis of volunteer notes

### Image Processing (Future)

- Pet identification from photos
- Health assessment from images
- Breed identification and verification

## Usage

```python
from pawpass.ai import get_recommendations, analyze_behavior, process_text

# Get care recommendations for a pet
recommendations = get_recommendations(
    pet_id=123,
    recommendation_type="diet",
    recent_days=30
)

# Analyze behavior patterns from updates
behavior_insights = analyze_behavior(
    pet_id=123,
    timeframe="past_month"
)

# Process and analyze update text
text_analysis = process_text(
    update_text="Buddy was very energetic today and ate well, but seemed slightly limping on his left paw."
)
```

## AI Models

The module integrates with various AI models:

- **NLP Models**: For text analysis of pet updates
- **Time Series Models**: For pattern detection in pet behavior
- **Recommendation Systems**: For pet care suggestions
- **Image Recognition Models**: For pet photo analysis (future)

## Integration Points

- Core application: For access to pet data
- Database: For storing and retrieving AI-generated insights
- External AI services: For specialized processing

## Configuration

AI services are configured through environment variables:

- `AI_PROVIDER`: The AI service provider (openai, azure, huggingface)
- `AI_API_KEY`: API key for the AI service
- `AI_MODEL_ENDPOINT`: Endpoint URL for custom models
- `AI_PROCESSING_LEVEL`: Level of AI processing (basic, standard, advanced)

## Privacy and Ethics

- All data processing follows privacy regulations
- Pet owner consent is required for AI analysis
- Recommendations are provided as suggestions, not directives
- All AI decisions can be reviewed by human experts
