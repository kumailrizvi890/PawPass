# PawPass

## Overview
PawPass is a lightweight web platform designed for animal shelters and foster volunteers to easily transfer pet information between shifts, volunteers, fosters, and shelters without relying on emails and Excel sheets. The application is built as a Progressive Web App (PWA) with offline functionality and database persistence, featuring a custom logo and user-friendly interface that facilitates seamless pet care coordination.

## Features
- **Pet Profiles**: Create and manage detailed pet information
- **Care Updates**: Log updates about pet care and behavior
- **Shift Checklists**: Track completed care tasks during shifts
- **Image Upload**: Upload and manage pet photos
- **Emergency Flagging**: Mark pets requiring urgent care
- **Progressive Web App**: Works offline and can be installed on devices
- **Accessibility**: Color-blind friendly mode
- **Search Functionality**: Quickly find pets by name

## Architecture
The application follows a modular architecture with the following components:

### Module Boundaries
- **Auth**: Authentication and authorization services
- **Email**: Email processing and notifications
- **AI**: AI integration for pet care recommendations
- **Encryption**: Data security and encryption
- **Quantum**: Azure Quantum integration (future capability)

### Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Flask (Python)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **PWA Support**: Service Worker, App Manifest

### API Endpoints
| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/pets` | GET | Retrieve all pets |
| `/api/pets/<id>` | GET | Get a specific pet |
| `/api/pets/<id>/update` | POST | Add an update to a pet |
| `/api/pets/<id>/checklist` | POST | Add a checklist to a pet |

## Integration Patterns
- **Database Integration**: Direct ORM integration with PostgreSQL
- **Authentication**: Session-based authentication (future implementation)
- **PWA**: Cache-first strategy with background sync for offline mode
- **Image Upload**: Multipart form data with server-side processing
- **Search**: Database query pattern with real-time results

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set up PostgreSQL database
4. Run the application: `gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:5000 main:app`

## Development
- Follow PEP 8 for Python code
- Document all functions and modules
