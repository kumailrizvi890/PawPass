# PawPass Architecture

## System Architecture Overview

PawPass is built using a modular architecture that separates concerns into distinct modules, making the codebase easier to maintain, test, and extend. The application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern and is implemented using Flask for the backend, PostgreSQL for data storage, and HTML/CSS/JavaScript for the frontend.

## Progressive Web App (PWA) Implementation

The application is designed as a Progressive Web App with the following features:

- **Offline Support**: Service workers cache essential resources and data
- **Background Sync**: Updates made while offline are synchronized when online
- **App Installation**: Users can install the app on their devices
- **Push Notifications**: Important updates are delivered as notifications

## Security Considerations

- All user data is encrypted at rest and in transit
- Authentication uses industry best practices
- Regular security audits ensure application safety
- Data access is controlled through proper authorization
- Sensitive operations require re-authentication

## Deployment Architecture

The application is designed to be deployed in various environments:

- **Development**: Local deployment for development and testing
- **Staging**: Pre-production environment for verification
- **Production**: Fully scaled production environment with high availability

Each environment uses appropriate scaling and redundancy measures to ensure performance and reliability.
